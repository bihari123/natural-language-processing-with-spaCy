#The Doc is one of the central data structures in spaCy. It's created automatically when you process a text with the nlp object. But you can also instantiate the class manually.

# After creating the nlp object, we can import the Doc class from spacy.tokens.

# Here we're creating a doc from three words. The spaces are a list of boolean values indicating whether the word is followed by a space. Every token includes that information â€“ even the last one!

# The Doc class takes three arguments: the shared vocab, the words and the spaces.

# Create an nlp object
import spacy
nlp = spacy.blank("en")

# Import the Doc class
from spacy.tokens import Doc

# The words and spaces to create the doc from
words = ["Hello", "world", "!"]
spaces = [True, False, False]

# Create a doc manually
doc = Doc(nlp.vocab, words=words, spaces=spaces)
